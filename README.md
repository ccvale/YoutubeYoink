# YoutubeYoink

## Because who the hell wants to keep going to shady sites?

A quick GUI tool made for fun/my individual use. Written in Python with `CustomTKinter` to rip either MP3 (raw audio) or MP4 (the full video content) files from YouTube videos.

## Installation

I figured that since I created an executable I would also include a way to download the `.exe` that was created for this project, since I made one to use:

```bash
  see somewhere...
```

## Run Locally

If you want to check out the project, but don't want to download the executable, feel free to do the following:

- Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/ccvale/YoutubeYoink.git
```

- Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd YoutubeYoink
```

- Install the required packages

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Run the program

```bash
  python app.py
```
