# YoutubeYoink

## Because who the hell wants to keep going to shady sites?

A quick GUI tool made for fun/my individual use. Written in Python with `CustomTKinter` to rip either MP3 (raw audio) or MP4 (the full video content) files from YouTube videos.

## Run Locally

I created an executable of this project for my other devices but am lazy to get it on here, but feel free to do the following:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/ccvale/YoutubeYoink.git
```

- Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd YoutubeYoink
```

- Install the required packages

```bash
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

- Run the program

```bash
  python3 app.py
```
